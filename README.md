# KID2 â€“ You Stitch It API

A Flask-based REST API for stitching multiple images into panoramic views using OpenCV. This service provides high-quality image stitching with intelligent preprocessing and post-processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Multi-image panorama stitching** - Combines 2 or more overlapping images into seamless panoramas
- **Intelligent preprocessing** - CLAHE enhancement and optimal resizing for better feature detection
- **High-quality output** - Alpha channel support with transparent border cropping
- **Multiple stitching modes** - Automatic fallback between PANORAMA and SCANS modes
- **CORS support** - Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **Docker ready** - Containerized deployment support

## API Endpoints

### POST /stitchPanorama

Stitches multiple images into a panoramic view.

**Request:**
- Method: `POST`
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Body: Multiple image files under the `images` field

**Response:**
- Success: PNG image file with alpha channel
- Error: JSON object with error message

**Example using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "images=@image1.jpg" \
  -F "images=@image2.jpg" \
  -F "images=@image3.jpg" \
  http://localhost:8080/stitchPanorama \
  --output panorama.png
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Waitress
- Flask-CORS

## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dw-innovation/kid2-you-stitch-it-api
cd kid2-you-stitch-it-api
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app/app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t you-stitch-it-api .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ORIGINS="*" you-stitch-it-api
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (default: "*")

Example:
```bash
export ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://youstitch.it"
```

## Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Validation** - Ensures minimum 2 images are provided
2. **Preprocessing** - CLAHE enhancement on LAB color space L-channel
3. **Resizing** - Intelligent resizing to max 2000px dimension for optimal processing
4. **Stitching** - Multi-mode stitching with automatic fallback
5. **Post-processing** - Alpha channel creation and transparent border cropping
6. **Output** - High-quality PNG with transparency support

## Error Handling

The API provides detailed error messages for common issues:

- `Need more images for stitching` - Insufficient overlap between images
- `Homography estimation failed` - Images don't have enough matching features
- `Camera parameter adjustment failed` - Internal stitching algorithm failure

## Performance Notes

- Images are automatically resized to 2000px max dimension for processing
- CLAHE preprocessing improves feature detection in challenging lighting
- Multiple stitching modes ensure best results for different image sets
- Transparent output allows seamless integration into other applications
